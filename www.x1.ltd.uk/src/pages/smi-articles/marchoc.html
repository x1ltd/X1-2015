<p class="para-bodyA">P.S. The question “Why do we love chocolate?” was asked of Paul A. Young (Master Chocolatier) in a program broadcast on BBC Two. He answered, “It makes us really happy. It’s not just the sugar, it’s the feeling, the texture, the nostalgic reminiscence of childhood… hand anyone chocolate and they will smile.”</p>
