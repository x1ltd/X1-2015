  <p class="para-bodyA">Successful sales people know a lot about their customers, and they use this information with sensitivity and discretion.<br></p>

<p class="para-bodyA">It’s easy to think that marketing is all about information. It’s not!<br></p>

<p class="para-bodyA">Data alone does not guarantee appetising results. How you use it does.<br></p>

<p class="para-bodyA">Like the best chefs, skilled marketers are sensitive to those they serve. They are careful in what they say and how they say it. <br></p>

<p class="para-bodyA">Use information for more than just closing sales. Be helpful. Build relationships. Exercise discretion in how often you contact customers. Honesty and sensitivity will win people’s trust, and keep them coming back for more.<br></p>
