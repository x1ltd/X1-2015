               <p class="para-bodyQ">“When our business’ print and direct marketing requirements began to grow exponentially we looked to X1 to take care of all of our requirements in these areas. Since making that decision we have been constantly delighted by the service we have received. The quality of the print, digital platforms and direct marketing innovations, (we particularly like our videobooks) are fantastic and X1 has never let us down on getting materials to our customers on time. The staff are always friendly, courteous and patient, and take the time to understand our requirements and offer expert guidance on how we can meet our needs. Partnering with X1 has proved to deliver significant financial and operational benefits to Barrel & Stone which has allowed us to focus on growing even faster in the future.”
