    	<p class="para-subheadA">The X1 Design Library</p>
        <p class="para-bodyA">The X1 Design Library is a free online resource that can be used
 to source proven product designs that could be useful to your business.</p>

<p class="para-bodyA">The database is updated every 2 weeks and currently has over 2000 items. They include packaging, binders, folders, cases, point of sale solutions and much more.</p>

<p class="para-bodyA">Simply type a description of the type of product your are looking for in the search box and when you find what you are looking for, click on the 'request info' button, and fill in your details and any other relevant information.</p>

<p class="para-bodyA">The X1 Design Library can also be used to promote these proven designs to your own customers. By directing customers to your version of The Design Library you can expand your product offering and receive their emailed enquiries direct to your inbox.</p>

<p class="para-bodyA">A personal unbranded site is free or, for an investment of just £100.00, we can set up a fully branded copy of The Design Library with your logo on every page plus a 'return to your site' button with a direct link to your main website. We can also include links to your social networks along with your logo.</p>

<p class="para-bodyA">When you have set up your own site, you can also add your own product designs to The Design Library and let us and our partners promote them for you.</p>

<p class="para-bodyA">Once you have introduced customers to The Design Library, they may see an opportunity for promoting designs to their own clients under their own brand and you could handle this for them and be copied in on any enquiries.</p>

<p class="para-bodyA">Setting up your own copy of The Design Library is simple – just <a href="http://www.thedesignlibrary.co.uk/sign-up-to-the-design-library-original">click here</a> and complete the form.</p>
