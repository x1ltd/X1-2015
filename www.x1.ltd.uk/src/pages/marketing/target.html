        <p class="para-introA">Right data is the key.</p>
        <p class="para-subheadA">Target engagement</p>
        <p class="para-bodyA">After describing and finding your target you need to profile the individuals or companies in your target list in order to be able to create an effective engagement. You should create the profiles based on what you need to know from your target list that will help you be more relevant and helpful when you contact them.
  <p class="para-bodyA">Defining what is important will provide focus and make it easier and faster for you to get the information you need â€” either from data sources or directly from your target. Often marketers make the simple mistake of profiling their target based on what they know (Big Data) instead of what they need to know (Right Data).
        <p class="para-bodyA">If you blindly profile based only on what you know, your profiles will be weak and your communication poor. Strong profiling will enable you to drive the right message/offer with the right design, the right number of touches via the right channels.
