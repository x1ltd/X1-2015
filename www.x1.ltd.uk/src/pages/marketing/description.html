		<p class="para-subheadA">3 simple and effective steps in a Direct Marketing Campaign</p>
		<p class="para-bodyB">1. Target Description and Finding</p>
		<p class="para-bodyA">Describing a target is one of the most critical steps in a marketing program as you don’t want to be wasting your precious marketing money on the wrong people.</p>
		<p class="para-bodyA">Most marketers define their target by looking at the individuals that already buy from them. This means they are learning what is working for them before trying to find individuals with similar characteristics to target. There are two other considerations that apply to this simple process:</p>
		<p class="para-bodyA">
			<FONT COLOR="#a6032f">Engagement Failure. </FONT>There will be people that didn’t buy not because they aren’t a target but because of failure to communicate successfully with them.</p>
		<p class="para-bodyA">
			<FONT COLOR="#a6032f">Market Changes. </FONT>The market is constantly changing – competitor values, the economy, even your own company’s unique selling points. These changes will alter the target description. If marketers only listen to data analytics to describe a target, they run the risk of describing a target of the past rather than the target of the present.</p>
		<p class="para-bodyA">We provide an intelligent data analytic service combined with the human element in the data strategy to help describe a target. Once a target has been properly described it is much easier to find it!</p>
		<p class="para-bodyB">2. Target engagement</p>
		<p class="para-bodyA">After describing and finding a target, individuals and/or companies need to be profiled to create an effective engagement. Profiles should be created based on what needs to be known from individuals (and companies with B2B) in a target list to be able to achieve a relevant and helpful contact.</p>
		<p class="para-bodyA">Defining what is important to know will provide focus and make it easier and faster for a marketer to get the information that is needed – either from data sources or directly from the target. Often marketers make the simple mistake of profiling their target based on what they know (Big Data) instead of what they need to know (Right Data).</p>
		<p class="para-bodyA">Profiles might be weak and the communication poor if profiles are only created based on what is known. Strong profiling will enable you to:</p>
		<p class="para-bodyA">— drive the right message</p>
		<p class="para-bodyA">— offer the appropriate design/creativity</p>
		<p class="para-bodyA">— deliver the right number of touches via the right channels.</p>
		<p class="para-bodyA">Please contact us if you need support with describing your target and/or profiling it.</p>
		<p class="para-bodyA">The last step of a successful engagement is always to make it easy for the target to buy. Pay special attention to your online presence, where competitors are only one click away. Besides using incentives to encourage someone to purchase, making sure the buying process is clear, quick and frustration-free is critical.</p>
		<p class="para-bodyA">Not long ago, customers had to travel to the nearest store to buy something that they have seen advertised. Timing is always critical and therefore it is imperative to be able to quickly and easily drive a target from a promotional/marketing piece such a direct mailer, email or SMS to your shop.</p>
		<p class="para-bodyA">We offer a wide choice of technologies and techniques that can help you do that, including:</p>
		<p class="para-bodyA">—

			<FONT COLOR="#a6032f">Gaming</FONT> on a Direct Mailer and/or Emailers that will encourage recipients to go either to your nearest shop or online to see if they won a prize.

		<p class="para-bodyB">3. Campaign Tracking and Analytics</p>
		<p class="para-bodyA">Analysing what went right and wrong with a campaign is impossible without effective tracking. Fine-tuning to increase the success levels of your marketing is hard to achieve without campaign analytics and knowledge:</p>
		<p class="para-bodyA">-
			<FONT COLOR="#a6032f">Know if your campaign was successful</FONT>. Was the return bigger than the investment? We must be careful here as some campaigns might not give a positive return on marketing investment right from the beginning. It doesn’t mean that they were unsuccessful; sometimes it takes more than one campaign to start building positive Return on Investment (ROI). Some campaigns only succeed because previous ones failed. Retrieving relevant information and improving results are good signs that we are on the right path.</p>
		<p class="para-bodyA">-
			<FONT COLOR="#a6032f">Know the cost of acquiring a new customer</FONT> by dividing the investment by the number of new customers that were acquired. This will help estimate how much is needed to sell to a customer in order to make it profitable.</p>
		<p class="para-bodyA">-
			<FONT COLOR="#a6032f">Know how to improve future campaigns</FONT>. We’ll help you track who responded to what and who didn’t. Also, who bought what and who didn’t. Simple information helps improve future campaigns. Knowing which profiles responded and purchased, and which ones did not, helps you to invest more on what is working and fix what is not. It helps identify which profiles are failing and which ones are being successful in the awareness and closing phases:</p>
		<p class="para-bodyA">— Profiles that do not respond will have to be analysed to discern whether they are truly a target or if the communication just failed to resonate with them.</p>
		<p class="para-bodyA">— Guidance is provided towards what the best customers and therefore targets look like.</p>
		<p class="para-bodyA">— Profiles that respond but do not buy have to be looked at in a different way, too. Why aren’t they converting into sales? Is it easy and clear to buy? Is it a problem with pricing? What could be wrong?</p>
