        <p class="para-subheadA">Web-2-Promotion</p>
        <p class="para-bodyA">If you  market through channels such as distributors, franchises and sales offices etc. you face the challenges related to centralised and decentralised marketing.
                  <p class="para-subheadB">Centralised Marketing</p>

          <p class="para-bodyA">If you choose centralised marketing, you have control and can deliver a consistent brand message. However, you run the risk of missing the opportunity to allow your local sales and marketing resources, who are closest to the customer, help you improve your marketing relevance for each location.
          <p class="para-subheadB">Decentralised Marketing</p>
          <p class="para-bodyA">If you choose decentralised marketing, you put your marketing and branding in the hands of thousands of different shops and channels. Your key messages can become fuzzy and weak and the quality of your marketing materials can become inconsistent and shoddy.
