    <p class="para-bodyA">Money is an essential marketing ingredient. </p>
    <p class="para-bodyA">But money, like other good ingredients such as information, sensitivity and creativity, can’t guarantee success on its own. It is not only about how deep your marketing pockets are but most importantly about how you are going to invest your money. For example, the excitement about the vast number of different media channels available today can cause even well-seasoned marketers to allocating their precious marketing budgets to a wide range of media channels before forming a solid marketing strategy.</p>
    <p class="para-bodyA">They do this by trying to attribute sales (success) to specific channels to be able to determine which ones are the best.  This is like trying to identify what single customer visit drove a sale within a complete sale cycle executed by a sales rep.  Channel attribution is a difficult discussion as it is not just the media channels that make marketing successful but the strategy behind them. </p>
    <p class="para-bodyA">From a marketing and selling perspective allocating marketing budgets to channels without a clear strategy in mind is fundamentally wrong; it puts the carriage in front of the horse. All media channels can be great enablers but cannot sell your products without the right strategy behind them. The strategy drives the marketing investment and media channel/s selection, and not the other way around. </p>
    <p class="para-bodyA">When marketers choose the channels first, the chance of choosing the wrong ones increases and so does the risk of wasting  marketing money. Without a proper strategy, media channel criteria is often based on the following:  pure cost instead of Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI); speed instead of sales productivity; and quantity of contacts instead of quality.  </p>
    <p class="para-bodyA">Some media channels are cheaper than others but that doesn’t always mean they cost less.  Some channels are faster to implement than others but that doesn’t guarantee they will bring you more sales. Some channels hit large quantities of people but that doesn’t mean they are your prospects or that you are contacting them in the most effective way. The right strategy drives the right activities and the right media channel/s selection, helping you distribute your marketing budget in the most effective way. The strategy tells you how to invest your marketing budget instead of building the strategy based on how much you can afford to spend.</p>
