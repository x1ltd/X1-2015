    	<p class="para-subheadA">Direct Mail</p>
        <p class="para-bodyA">There are many reasons why over 4 billion pieces of direct mail are delivered in the UK each year.
<p class="para-bodyA">It is faster to produce. You can prepare and mail a small promotion within weeks rather than months. This makes it perfect for testing the latest prices, offers and audiences.
<p class="para-bodyA">Response is faster. You can see the results of a mailing more quickly and accurately than you can with most other advertising.
<p class="para-bodyA">It is cost-effective. Using digital printing, X1 can mail to lists as small as 200.
<p class="para-bodyA">X1 can target your mailings more selectively, meaning more results and less wasted effort.
<p class="para-bodyA">It is more flexible. After testing a promotion, X1 can adjust it based on initial feedback.
<p class="para-bodyA">Direct mail is more personal. Not only can letters be personalised via mail-merging techniques, but you can use more informal language in writing your letter and can direct your letter to the specific interest of the reader.
<p class="para-bodyA">It can build a list of loyal customers. Direct mail allows you to build and maintain an in-house list of ‘premium prospects’.
<p class="para-bodyA">- A postal database provides demographic information about a target audience. Marketers can then profile the different individuals in that target audience to be able to engage them in a more relevant way.
<p class="para-bodyA">- There is no screening in the postal delivery, the direct mail that you send is what your recipients will get.
<p class="para-bodyA">- People receive far more emails and/or mobile text messages than postal pieces, so there is far more competition on email and mobile devices than on the postal mailbox. You can catch their target’s attention easier in a postal mailbox than anywhere else. 
<p class="para-bodyA">- Recipients tend to be less stressed while going through their postal mail at home versus while working on their computers or on their mobile devices. It is easier to capture the attention of recipients when they are more relaxed.
<p class="para-bodyA">- Through the postal mail, marketers can better capture their target’s attention by attaching promotional items to a direct mailing piece. Also, since creativity and design on paper is tactile and tangible, it is easier for marketers to show the value of what they sell.
