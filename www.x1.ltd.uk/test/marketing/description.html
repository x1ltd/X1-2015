<p><p class="para-introA">Describing a target is one of the most critical steps in a marketing program.</p></p>
<p><p class="para-subheadA">Description and target finding</p></p>
<p><p class="para-bodyA"> Most marketers define their target by looking at the individuals that already buy from them.</p></p>
<p><p class="para-bodyA"> In actuality, they are learning what is working for them and therefore trying to find individuals with similar characteristics to target. Proper description of a target takes a bit more thought, and you fail here you will be wasting precious marketing money on the wrong people.</p></p>
<p><p class="para-bodyA">  You also need to look at the individuals that didn’t buy. The people that didn’t buy because you failed to communicate successfully with them. </p></p>
<p><p class="para-bodyA">The market is constantly changing – competitor values, the economy, even your own company’s unique selling points. These changes will  alter the target description. If you only listen to data analytics to describe a target, you run the risk of describing a target of the past rather than the target of the present.</p></p>
