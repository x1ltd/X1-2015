<p><p class="para-bodyA">What is it? </p></p>
<p><p class="para-bodyA">Some people call it ‘Fulfilment’, others ‘Pick ‘n’ pack’. We describe it (less snappily) as ‘The jobs you don’t have the time, skills or resources to do’.</p>
<p><p class="para-bodyA">At our modern, dedicated factory premises, we store and control our customers’ assets. Customer orders are constantly being processed via our Web-2-Production software, your online ordering systems, phone, email, post or fax. Our team picks out the specified assets before packing them to pre-defined specifications. We then administer all the necessary documentation before despatching them (with your own paperwork where required).</p>
<p><p class="para-bodyA">We use carefully chosen carriers to deliver your products to distribution centres or direct to consumers, anywhere in the world. Our service includes the facility to provide end-of-month delivery and stock reports.
