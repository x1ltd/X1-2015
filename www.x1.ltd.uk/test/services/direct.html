<p><p class="para-subheadA">Direct Mail</p></p>
<p><p class="para-bodyA">Over 4 billion pieces of direct mail are delivered in the UK each year. There are some very good reasons for this.</p></p>
<p><p class="para-bodyA">You can prepare and mail a small promotion within weeks rather than months. This makes it a perfect vehicle for testing the latest prices, offers and audiences.</p></p>
<p><p class="para-bodyA">Response is faster. You  see the results of a mailing more quickly and accurately than with most other advertising.</p></p>
<p><p class="para-bodyQ">“69% open all the mail they receive vs 22% open all the emails – 47% say they receive too much mail vs 70% who say they receive too many emails.”</p></p>
<p><p class="para-bodyC">Source: Quadrangle, Mail &amp; Digital, Part 1, 2013</p></p>
<p><p class="para-bodyA">It is cost-effective. X1 can mail to lists as small as 200. And X1 will target your mailings, meaning more results and less wasted effort.</p></p>
<p><p class="para-bodyA">It is more flexible. After testing a promotion, X1 can fine-tune it based on initial feedback.</p></p>
<p><p class="para-bodyA">It is more personal. Not only can letters be personalised via mail-merging techniques, but you can use more informal language in writing your letter and can direct your letter to the specific interest of the reader.</p>
<p><p class="para-bodyA">It can build a list of loyal customers. Direct mail allows you to build and maintain an in-house list of ‘premium prospects’.</p></p>
<p><p class="para-bodyQ">“1 in 3 not only look forward to the mail arriving but are disappointed if they don’t receive anything – 70% enjoy receiving vouchers, coupons  and discounts through the post.”</p></p>
<p><p class="para-bodyC">Source: DMA from the letter box to the inbox, building customers relationships, 2013</p></p>
<p><p class="para-bodyA">A postal database provides demographic information about a target audience. Marketers can  profile the different individuals in that target audience to be able to engage them in a more relevant way.</p>
<p><p class="para-bodyA">There is no screening – there is no junk mail filter with direct mail, your recipient will receive what you send them.</p></p>
<p><p class="para-bodyA">People receive far more emails and text messages than postal pieces. Sending an item in the mail means you have more chance of catching your target’s attention.</p>
<p><p class="para-bodyA">Marketers can capture their target’s attention by attaching promotional items to a direct mailing piece. Also, paper is tactile and tangible, making it easier for marketers to show the value of what they sell.</p>
