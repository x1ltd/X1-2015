<h1>The Alien Logic of Both/And</h1>

<p>My former colleague, Lish Eves taught that our western/Greek logic is based on &lsquo;either/or&rsquo; &ndash; we deduce things with the default that one thing will exclude the other thing. This has been a useful shortcut in, for instance, Newtonian
  physics, but turns out to be a real drawback in our attempts to understand quantum mechanics.</p>

<blockquote>Different cultures see things in very different ways</blockquote>

<p>But, she said, many other non-western cultures, notably the ancient Hebrews, have a default logic that is &lsquo;both/and&rsquo; &ndash; this makes them appear to us illogical and incapable of reasoning when in fact it&rsquo;s merely a different kind
  of reasoning and the only way of dealing with some truths.</p>

<p>Einstein rejected quantum physics because he was an &lsquo;either/or&rsquo; person. But light IS both wave and particle; there are occasions where the photon/electron or whatever IS in superposition &ndash; both here and there. Jesus IS fully human and
  fully divine. etc. For ancient Jews, my comical example is &ldquo;Your god does not exist, AND our God could beat him up with one hand tied behind his back, AND he doesn&rsquo;t have hands anyway.&rdquo; </p>

<p> To us, this is mildly amusing; I&rsquo;m not sure St Paul would understand why we think so.</p>

<p>In our lives, relationships are easier to see as &lsquo;both/and&rsquo;. Most westerners can conceive of a love/hate relationship when it comes to themselves. But the extreme modernist frequently complains, &ldquo;How can you say God is a God of love
  when X Y and Z?&rdquo; EITHER he is this and not that OR he is... etc.</p>

<p>You and I are culturally conditioned, I think, to lump things into either/or categories. Other cultures would find this arbitrary.</p>

<p>What I never got around to asking Lish is why it is that she thinks cultures need to be either one or the other.</p>

<h1>Less is More</h1>

<p>I was conversing with a colleague this morning and he reminded me of a sermon C.S. Lewis gave in Oxford, titled &lsquo;Transposition&rsquo;. </p>
<p class="absolute"> It features the analogy of a symphony transposed for solo piano. It&rsquo;s astonishing that such a feat can be done at all &ndash; but when it is done well, the person who knows the richer form &ndash; the multi-voiced orchestra &ndash; hears echoes
  of that in the simplified form &ndash; the lone piano.</p>

<p class="fixed"> Lewis uses it to explain how larger multi-dimensional spiritual truths might be represented on the relatively flat canvas of the physical portion of space-time which we mortals can perceive and process.</p>
