        <p class="para-bodyA">What is it? Some people call it ‘Fulfilment’, others ‘Pick ‘n’ pack’. We describe it (a little less snappily) as ‘The jobs you don’t have the time, skills or resources to do’!
<p class="para-bodyA">At our modern, dedicated factory premises, we store and control our customers’ assets. Customer orders are constantly being processed via our Web-2-Production software, your online ordering systems, phone, email, post or fax. Our team picks out the specified assets before packing them to pre-defined specifications. We then carefully administer all the necessary documentation before despatching them (with your own paperwork where required).
<p class="para-bodyA">We use carefully chosen carriers to deliver your products to distribution centres or direct to consumers, anywhere in the world. Our service includes the facility to provide end-of-month delivery and stock reports.
