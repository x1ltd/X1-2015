    	<p class="para-subheadA">Direct Mail</p>
        <p class="para-bodyA">There are many reasons why over 4 billion pieces of direct mail are delivered in the UK each year.
<p class="para-bodyA">It is faster to produce. You can prepare and mail a small promotion within weeks rather than months. This makes it perfect for testing the latest prices, offers and audiences.
<p class="para-bodyA">Response is faster. You can see the results of a mailing more quickly and accurately than you can with most other advertising.
<p class="para-bodyA">It is cost-effective. Using digital printing, X1 can mail to lists as small as 200.
<p class="para-bodyA">X1 can target your mailings more selectively, meaning more results and less wasted effort.
<p class="para-bodyA">It is more flexible. After testing a promotion, X1 can adjust it based on initial feedback.
<p class="para-bodyA">Direct mail is more personal. Not only can letters be personalised via mail-merging techniques, but you can use more informal language in writing your letter and can direct your letter to the specific interest of the reader.
<p class="para-bodyA">It can build a list of loyal customers. Direct mail allows you to build and maintain an in-house list of ‘premium prospects’.
