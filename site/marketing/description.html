        <p class="para-introA">Describing a target is one of the most critical steps in a marketing program.</p>
        <p class="para-subheadA">Description and Target Finding</p>
        <p class="para-bodyA">If you fail here, you will end up wasting precious marketing money on the wrong people.<br>
         <p class="para-bodyA"> Most marketers today describe their target by looking at the individuals that already buy from them.
         <p class="para-bodyA"> In actuality, they are learning what is working for them and therefore trying to find individuals with similar characteristics to target. Proper description of a target takes a bit more thought.
  <p class="para-bodyA">  You need to look at the individuals that did not buy – the targets that didn’t buy because you failed to communicate successfully with them. Also, the market is constantly changing – competitor values, the economy, even your own company’s unique selling points. These changes will  alter the target description. If you only listen to data analytics to describe a target, you run the risk of describing a target of the past rather than the target of the present.
     <p class="para-bodyA">   We provide you with an intelligent data analytic service combined with the human element in the data strategy that will better describe your target. Once your target has been properly described it is much easier to find it!</p>
