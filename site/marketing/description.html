        <p class="para-introA">Describing a target is one of the most critical steps in a marketing program.</p>
        <p class="para-subheadA">Description and Target finding</p>
        <p class="para-bodyA">If you fail here, you will end up wasting a precious marketing money on the wrong people.<br>
         <p class="para-bodyA"> Most marketers today describe their target just by looking at the individuals that already buy from them. They will use analytics to do just that.
         <p class="para-bodyA"> In actuality, they are learning what is working for them and therefore trying to find individuals with similar characteristics to target. Proper description of a target takes a bit more work than just looking at your current customers.
        <p class="para-bodyA">  You need to look at the individuals that did not buy – the targets that didn’t buy because you failed to communicate successfully with them. Also, the market is constantly changing – competitor’s values, the economy, even your own company’s unique selling points. These changes will also alter the target description. If you only listen to the data analytics to describe a target, you run the risk of describing a target of the past rather than a real target of the present.
