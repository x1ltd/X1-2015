        <p class="para-introA">Right Data is the Key.</p>
        <p class="para-subheadA">Target Engagement</p>
        <p class="para-bodyA">After describing and finding your target you need to profile the different individuals or companies in your target list in order to be able to create an effective engagement. You should create the profiles based on what you need to know from your target list that will help you be more relevant and helpful when you contact them. <p class="para-bodyA">Defining first what is important will provide focus and will make it easier and faster for you to get the information you need — either from data sources or directly from your target. Often marketers make the simple mistake of profiling their target based on what they know (Big Data) instead of what they need to know (Right Data). 
        <p class="para-bodyA">If you blindly profile based only on what you know, and that doesn’t provide you with enough information to attempt relevance with your target, your profiles will be weak and your communication most likely will fail. Strong profiling should drive the right message/offer, with the right design, the right number of touches, even the right channels.
          <p class="para-bodyA">Once the profiles have been created you should group the different individuals and/or companies that share similar characteristics in your target list into the same profiles for greater productivity.<br>
      <p class="para-bodyA">  We can also use your data to help you organise your target into different profiles.</p>
