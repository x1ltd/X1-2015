        <p class="para-introA">If you don’t track you don’t know; how are you going to evolve without knowing?</p>
        <p class="para-subheadA">What to track, When and How?</p>
        <p class="para-bodyA">It is critical to know what, when, how and why you will track and analyze. We’ll help you track and analyze so you can:</p>
         <p class="para-bodyA"> Know if your campaign was successful. Was the return bigger than the investment? We will be careful here as some campaigns might not give a positive return on marketing investment right from the beginning. It doesn’t mean that they were unsuccessful; sometimes it takes more than one campaign to start building positive ROI. Some campaigns only succeed because previous ones failed. Retrieving relevant information and improving results are good signs that we are on the right path.</p>
         <p class="para-bodyA"> Know the cost of acquiring a new customer by dividing the investment by the number of new customers that were acquired. This will help you estimate how much do you have to sell to a customer in order to make it profitable.</p>
      <p class="para-bodyA">  Know how to improve future campaigns. we’ll help you track who responded to what and who didn’t? Also, who bought what and who didn’t? Simple information could help tremendously to improve your future campaigns; in some cases even the products that you sell. Knowing which profiles responded and bought and which ones did not helps you invest more on what is working and fix what is not. It helps you identify which profiles are failing and be successful in the awareness and/or closing phases. Knowing which profiles are responding but also buying is very helpful as we can proactively try to find more customers that look like them. Profiles that do not respond will have to be analyzed. We’ll have to decide if they are truly your target or if the communication just failed to resonate with them. Profiles that respond but do not buy have to be looked at in a different way, too. Why aren’t they converting into sales? Is it easy and clear how to buy? Is it a problem with pricing? What could be wrong? Historically marketers could only track and measure how much sales a campaign generated. Today we help our customers track and measure sales, but most importantly who responded and who did not, and who bought and who did not.</p>
