        <p class="para-bodyA">If you go to market through channels such as distributors, franchises, sales offices etc. you probably experience the challenges related to centralised and decentralised marketing.
                  <p class="para-subheadB">Centralised Marketing</p>

          <p class="para-bodyA">If you choose centralised marketing, you will have control and can deliver a consistent brand message. However, you will miss out on the opportunity to allow your local sales and marketing resources, who are closest to the customer, to help you improve your marketing relevance for each location.
          <p class="para-subheadB">Decentralised Marketing</p>
          <p class="para-bodyA">If you choose decentralised marketing, you potentially put your marketing and branding in the hands of thousands of different shops and channels. Your key messages may become fuzzy and weak and the quality of your marketing materials such as print inconsistent and in some cases not good enough.
          <p class="para-bodyA">Our Web-2-Promotion online portal can be branded to your company allowing your sales and marketing authorized channels and employees to quickly and easily order what they need, when they need it, and from where ever they are office, home, or even while on the move, from iPhone or iPads. Also Web-2-Promotion allows your channels and employees to fine tune the printing marketing materials that they order only on the areas that are authorized by you. You will still build and own the marketing strategy via the portal, and decide which marketing materials and merchandise such as promotional items are the most relevant to have for each location based on your strategy. Further more you could also choose who of your channels will have access to what materials.<br>
          <p class="para-bodyA">Web-2-Promotion will help you market more effectively across different territories; also providing you with the opportunity to track your channels and activities for further analysis, assessment and support.<br>
