        <p class="para-subheadA">Direct & Digital Marketing Media Allocation</p>
        <p class="para-bodyA">In order to be successful, marketers today need to interact better, more quickly, more often, and more cost effectively with their targets. That is why all direct and digital marketing media channels—including digital printing/postal mail—with their flexibility and speed, are very relevant. These channels also complement each other and can effectively support your strategy. 
<p class="para-bodyA">These channels or vehicles will help make your next direct marketing campaign more successful. All of these channels are very powerful if used properly, but none of them guarantee success by themselves neither without a good strategy behind them. In order for you to choose the right media channels for your next campaign, you will also need to understand each one of their strengths and weaknesses. </p>
